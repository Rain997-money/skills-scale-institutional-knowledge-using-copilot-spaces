# OctoAcme Project Management Docs

Welcome! This README serves as the entry point and central reference for how OctoAcme approaches project management. It provides a summary of our key processes and direct links to all documentation, ensuring team members have quick, reliable access to institutional knowledge.

## Overview of OctoAcme Project Management Processes

OctoAcme’s project management is designed for transparency, scalability, and continuous improvement. All workflows turn tacit knowledge into versioned, searchable documentation, empowering each team member to participate in process creation and refinement. Key practices include centralized documentation, collaborative validation, and repeatable execution supported by clear roles and peer review.

- **Project managers** oversee execution and compliance.
- **Process owners** curate and maintain process documents.
- **Subject matter experts** contribute deep expertise.
- **Contributors** can propose improvements via issue templates.

Communication is open and tracked through GitHub issues and pull requests. Quality assurance is integrated—every process update must be peer-reviewed and validated before adoption, supporting reliability, alignment, and efficient onboarding.
